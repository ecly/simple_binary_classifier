A very simple classifier made using CNN in Tensorflow.

### Usage
Expects a folder named `training_data` and one named `testing_data`.
The two folders should each have one fold for each class of images in the dataset.

Now simply run `python3 train.py` to train the classifier using the images in the `training_data` folder and `python3 evaluate.py` to see how well the trained classifier performs on the `testing_data`.
